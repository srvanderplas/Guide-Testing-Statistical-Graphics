  abstract = {Logarithmic transformations are a standard solution to displaying data that span several magnitudes within a single graph. This paper investigates the impact of log scales on perceptual sensitivity through a visual inference experiment using statistical lineups. Our study evaluated participant's ability to detect differences between exponentially increasing data, characterized by varying levels of curvature, using both linear and logarithmic scales. Participants were presented with a series of plots and asked to identify the panel that appeared most different from the others. Due to the choice of scale altering the contextual appearance of the data, the results revealed slight perceptual advantages for both scales depending on the curvatures of the compared data. This study serves as the initial part of a three-paper series dedicated to understanding the perceptual and cognitive implications of using logarithmic scales for visualizing exponentially increasing data. These studies serve as an example of multi-modal graphical testing, examining different levels of engagement and interaction with graphics to establish nuanced and specific guidelines for graphical design.},

  abstract = {Given that an effect size of d = .4 is a good first estimate of the smallest effect size of interest in psychological research, we already need over 50 participants for a simple comparison of two within-participants conditions if we want to run a study with 80\% power. This is more than current practice. In addition, as soon as a between-groups variable or an interaction is involved, numbers of 100, 200, and even more participants are needed. As long as we do not accept these facts, we will keep on running underpowered studies with unclear results. Addressing the issue requires a change in the way research is evaluated by supervisors, examiners, reviewers, and editors. The present paper describes reference numbers needed for the designs most often used by psychologists, including single-variable between-groups and repeated-measures designs with two and three levels, two-factor designs involving two repeated-measures variables or one between-groups variable and one repeated-measures variable (split-plot design). The numbers are given for the traditional, frequentist analysis with p \&lt; .05 and Bayesian analysis with BF \&gt; 10. These numbers provide researchers with a standard to determine (and justify) the sample size of an upcoming study. The article also describes how researchers can improve the power of their study by including multiple observations per condition per participant.},

  abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile--quantile (Q--Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q--Q plots shows that de-trended Q--Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

This is due to a breakdown of asymptotic results, boundary issues, and visible patterns in residual plots that are introduced by the model fitting process. Some of these issues are well known and adjustments have been proposed. Working with LME models typically requires that the analyst keeps track of all the special circumstances that may arise. In this article, we illustrate a simpler but generally applicable approach to diagnosing LME models. We explain how to use new visual inference methods for these purposes. The approach provides a unified framework for diagnosing LME fits and for model selection. We illustrate the use of this approach on several commonly available datasets. A large-scale Amazon Turk study was used to validate the methods. R code is provided for the analyses. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical structures are omnipresent in today's society---this is reflected in the data that we collect on all aspects of this society. Hierarchical linear models allow a representation of structural levels in a statistical modeling framework. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the quality of model estimation and explore features of the data not well described by the model. Residual and influence diagnostics are familiar tools for the classical regression model with independent observations. For hierarchical linear models, these diagnostic tools must be adjusted to reflect the dependence introduced by the nested data structure. Residual analysis now includes the assessment of distributional assumptions at each level of the model. This requires the use of level-dependent residual quantities. Similarly, the parameter estimates may be influenced at each level of the model, requiring influence diagnostics that can pinpoint specific levels of the model, as well as specific aspects of the model. We present an overview of the diagnostic tools available for hierarchical linear models that are familiar from linear models. Additionally, we discuss the utility of the lineup protocol for residual analysis with complex models.

It has been proposed as a mechanism for lending greater reliability and confidence to statistical inferences made from data graphics. The proposition is a seductive one, but whether or not line-ups guarantee consistent interpretation of statistical structure is an open question, especially when applied to representations of geo-spatial data. We build on empirical work around the extent to which statistical structure can be reliably judged in map line-ups, paying particular attention to the strategies employed when making line-up judgements. We conducted in-depth experiments with 19 graduate students equipped with a moderate background in geovisualization. The experiments consisted of a series of map line-up tasks with two map designs: choropleth maps and a centroid-dot alternative. We chose challenging tasks in the hope of exposing participants’ sensemaking activities. Through structured qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols, we identify six sensemaking strategies and evaluate their effects in making judgements from map line-ups. We find five sensemaking strategies applicable to most visualization types, but one that seems particular to map line-up designs. We could not identify one single successful strategy, but users adopt a mix of different strategies, depending on the circumstances. We also found that choropleth maps were easier to use than centroid-dot maps.},

	abstract = {H. R. Blackwell (1952) investigated the influence of different psychophysical methods and procedures on detection thresholds. He found that the temporal two-interval forced-choice method (2-{IFC}) combined with feedback, blocked constant stimulus presentation with few different stimulus intensities, and highly trained observers resulted in the “best” threshold estimates. This recommendation is in current practice in many psychophysical laboratories and has entered the psychophysicists' “folk wisdom” of how to run proper psychophysical experiments. However, Blackwell's recommendations explicitly require experienced observers, whereas many psychophysical studies, particularly with children or within a clinical setting, are performed with naïve observers. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we find a striking and consistent discrepancy between naïve observers' behavior and that reported for experienced observers by Blackwell: Naïve observers show the “best” threshold estimates for the spatial four-alternative forced-choice method (4-{AFC}) and the worst for the commonly employed temporal 2-{IFC}. We repeated our study with a highly experienced psychophysical observer, and he replicated Blackwell's findings exactly, thus suggesting that it is indeed the difference in psychophysical experience that causes the discrepancy between our findings and those of Blackwell. In addition, we explore the efficiency of different methods and show 4-{AFC} to be more than 3.5 times more efficient than 2-{IFC} under realistic conditions. While we have found that 4-{AFC} consistently gives lower thresholds than 2-{IFC} in detection tasks, we have found the opposite for discrimination tasks. This discrepancy suggests that there are large extrasensory influences on thresholds—sensory memory for {IFC} methods and spatial attention for spatial forced-choice methods—that are critical but, alas, not part of theoretical approaches to psychophysics such as signal detection theory.},

	abstract = {The psychometric function describes how an experimental variable, such as stimulus strength, influences the behaviour of an observer. Estimation of psychometric functions from experimental data plays a central role in fields such as psychophysics, experimental psychology and in the behavioural neurosciences. Experimental data may exhibit substantial overdispersion, which may result from non-stationarity in the behaviour of observers. Here we extend the standard binomial model which is typically used for psychometric function estimation to a beta-binomial model. We show that the use of the beta-binomial model makes it possible to determine accurate credible intervals even in data which exhibit substantial overdispersion. This goes beyond classical measures for overdispersion—goodness-of-fit—which can detect overdispersion but provide no method to do correct inference for overdispersed data. We use Bayesian inference methods for estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters of the psychometric function. Unlike previous Bayesian psychometric inference methods our software implementation—psignifit 4—performs numerical integration of the posterior within automatically determined bounds. This avoids the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods typically requiring expert knowledge. Extensive numerical tests show the validity of the approach and we discuss implications of overdispersion for experimental design. A comprehensive {MATLAB} toolbox implementing the method is freely available; a python implementation providing the basic capabilities is also available.},

	abstract = {Computational models are powerful tools for understanding human cognition and behavior. They let us express our theories clearly and precisely and offer predictions that can be subtle and often counter-intuitive. However, this same richness and ability to surprise means our scientific intuitions and traditional tools are ill-suited to designing experiments to test and compare these models. To avoid these pitfalls and realize the full potential of computational modeling, we require tools to design experiments that provide clear answers about what models explain human behavior and the auxiliary assumptions those models must make. Bayesian optimal experimental design ({BOED}) formalizes the search for optimal experimental designs by identifying experiments that are expected to yield informative data. In this work, we provide a tutorial on leveraging recent advances in {BOED} and machine learning to find optimal experiments for any kind of model that we can simulate data from, and show how by-products of this procedure allow for quick and straightforward evaluation of models and their parameters against real experimental data. As a case study, we consider theories of how people balance exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit decision-making tasks. We validate the presented approach using simulations and a real-world experiment. As compared to experimental designs commonly used in the literature, we show that our optimal designs more efficiently determine which of a set of models best account for individual human behavior, and more efficiently characterize behavior given a preferred model. At the same time, formalizing a scientific question such that it can be adequately addressed with {BOED} can be challenging and we discuss several potential caveats and pitfalls that practitioners should be aware of. We provide code to replicate all analyses as well as tutorial notebooks and pointers to adapt the methodology to different experimental settings.},

	abstract = {Examines the use of Rasch measurement models in the social sciences. This lucid introduction first focuses on general principles, so the applications and algebra of the model can be readily understood. Andrich then connects Rasch models to common procedures for social science measurement. Avoiding polemics, Andrich′s presentation allows comparison between the Rasch models and other, better known measurement approaches. Rasch Models For Measurement concentrates on the simple logistic model, the most elementary and commonly used of the Rasch models. This excellent introduction uses one example from personality inventory throughout to provide continuity as the procedures and statistical arguments are explained. Essential reading for all researchers and students who use measurement models. "A valuable asset to those of us who are concerned with teaching measurement issues. . . . My only quibble is that we have had to wait so long for what is a clear, concise and very approachable introduction to a fairly complex area. . . . For its size this volume covers a lot of ground and it would seem to be an ideal book for postgraduate students with a special interest in psychometrics and professional psychologists who are concerned with measurement and assessment. . . . An ideal primer." --The Statistician "Rasch Models for Measurement is a concise introduction to the general principles, philosophy, and methods that underlie the approach to measurement developed by Georg Rasch (1960/1980). This book is a welcome addition to the Sage series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences, or (as my students describe them) "the little green books." This series introduces methodological issues for individuals with limited backgrounds in statistics and mathematics, and Andrich has provided a useful resource for these individuals. . . . This book can be recommended for graduate students and colleagues who want a basic understanding of the Rasch model." --Applied Psychological Measurement},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences ({JNDs}), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between {JNDs} and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on {JND} for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model {JND} and find that {JND} grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the {JND} modeling in which elements below the fitted {JND} are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.},

But we also need to take “flaws” of the human perceptual system into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},

In this highly anticipated follow-up to The Functional Art—Alberto Cairo’s foundational guide to understanding information graphics and visualization—the respected data visualization professor explains in clear terms how to work with data, discover the stories hidden within, and share those stories with the world in the form of charts, maps, and infographics. In The Truthful Art, Cairo transforms elementary principles of data and scientific reasoning into tools that you can use in daily life to interpret data sets and extract stories from them.     The Truthful Art explains:   • The role infographics and data visualization play in our world • Basic principles of data and scientific reasoning that anyone can master • How to become a better critical thinker • Step-by-step processes that will help you evaluate any data visualization (including your own) • How to create and use effective charts, graphs, and data maps to explain data to any audience    The Truthful Art is also packed with inspirational and educational real-world examples of data visualizations from such leading publications as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Estado de São Paulo (Brazil), Berliner Morgenpost (Germany), and many more.},

With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you’ll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you’re working with–business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances–this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it.   You’ll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world’s most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler’s John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine’s Fernando Baptista, The New York Times’ Steve Duenes, The Washington Post’s Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford’s Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world’s leading designers.  The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals:  • Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art • How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking  • The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ • Best practices for creating interactive information graphics • A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ • An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world’s top designers and visual artists  On the DVD-ROM: In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You’ll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition.

It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. This foundation was designed for a distributed computing environment (Internet, Intranet, client-server), with special attention given to conserving computer code and system resources. While the tangible result of this work is a Java production graphics library (GPL) developed in collaboration with Dan Rope and Dan Carr, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underly the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, radar charts? These rules are abstracted from the work of Bertin, Cleveland, Kosslyn, MacEachren, Pinker, Tufte, Tukey, Tobler, and other theorists of quantitative graphics. Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce.

  abstract = {Objective: Online neuropsychological test batteries could allow for large-scale cognitive data collection in clinical studies. However, the few online neuropsychological test batteries that are currently available often still require supervision or lack proper psychometric evaluation. In this paper, we have outlined prerequisites for proper development and use of online neuropsychological tests, with the focus on reliable measurement of cognitive function in an unmonitored setting.Method: First, we identified several technical, contextual, and psychological factors that should be taken into account in order to facilitate reliable test results of online tests in the unmonitored setting. Second, we outlined a methodology of quality assurance needed in order to obtain reliable cognitive data in the long run.Results: Based on factors that distinguish the online unmonitored test setting from the traditional face-to-face setting, we provide a set of basic requirements and suggestions for optimal development and use of unmonitored online neuropsychological tests, including suggestions on acquiring reliability, validity, and norm scores.Conclusions: When properly addressing factors that could hamper reliable test results during development and use, online neuropsychological tests could aid large-scale data collection for clinical studies in the future. Investment in both proper development of online neuropsychological test platforms and the performance of accompanying psychometric studies is currently required.},

To identify the key aspects of data quality, we first engaged with the behavioral research community to discover which aspects are most critical to researchers and found that these include attention, comprehension, honesty, and reliability. We then explored differences in these data quality aspects in two studies (N\,{\textasciitilde}\,4000), with or without data quality filters (approval ratings). We found considerable differences between the sites, especially in comprehension, attention, and dishonesty. In Study 1 (without filters), we found that only Prolific provided high data quality on all measures. In Study 2 (with filters), we found high data quality among CloudResearch and Prolific. MTurk showed alarmingly low data quality even with data quality filters. We also found that while reputation (approval rating) did not predict data quality, frequency and purpose of usage did, especially on MTurk: the lowest data quality came from MTurk participants who report using the site as their main source of income but spend few hours on it per week. We provide a framework for future investigation into the ever-changing nature of data quality in online research, and how the evolving set of platforms and panels performs on these key aspects.},

In this paper, I review issues around web-based data collection for the purpose of numerical cognition research. Provided that the desired type of data can be collected through a web-browser, such online studies offer numerous advantages over traditional forms of physical lab-based data collection, such as gathering data from larger sample sizes in shorter time-windows and easier access to non-local populations. I then present results of two replication studies that employ classical paradigms in numerical cognition research: the number-size congruity paradigm and comparison to a given standard, which also included a masked priming manipulation. In both replications, reaction times and error rates were comparable to original, physical lab-based studies. Consistent with the results of original studies, a distance effect, a congruity effect, and a priming effect were observed. Data collected online thus offers a level of reliability comparable to data collected in a physical lab when it comes to questions in numerical cognition.},

This book aims to provide the practitioners of tomorrow with a memorable, easy to read, engaging guide to statistics and experimental design.  This book uses examples, drawn from a variety of established texts, and embeds them in a business or scientific context, seasoned with a dash of humor, to emphasize the issues and ideas that led to the experiment and the what-do-we-do-next? steps after the experiment. Graphical data displays are emphasized as means of discovery and communication and formulas are minimized, with a focus on interpreting the results that software produce. The role of subject-matter knowledge, and passion, is also illustrated. The examples do not require specialized knowledge, and the lessons they contain are transferrable to other contexts.   Fundamentals of Statistical Experimental Design and Analysis introduces the basic elements of an experimental design, and the basic concepts underlying statistical analyses. Subsequent chapters address the following families of experimental designs:    Completely Randomized designs, with single or multiple treatment factors, quantitative or qualitative Randomized Block designs Latin Square designs Split-Unit designs Repeated Measures designs Robust designs Optimal designs   Written in an accessible, student-friendly style, this book is suitable for a general audience and particularly for those professionals seeking to improve and apply their understanding of experimental design.},

  abstract = {Web surveys dominate contemporary data collection in numerous disciplines within the broadly understood social sciences. However, this mode of data collection comes with additional challenges, particularly related to careless or insufficient effort responding (C/IER), which can distort study results and poses a direct threat to the validity. One of the recommended approaches to address this problem is using attention checks, which are additional tasks or items with objective answers that indicate attentive responding. Despite the potential benefits of attention checks, recent evidence suggests that they are still not sufficiently researched to justify their uncritical use in screening out inattentive participants. This article provides an abridged review of the attention checks literature, offers evidence-based practical recommendations, and highlights crucial gaps in research regarding attention checks. Evidence-based recommendations concerning the type, number, and placement of attention checks in a survey are presented. Generally, including more than one attention check in a survey is advisable, especially for longer surveys. Long instructed manipulation checks should be avoided, instead, covert attention checks, which are difficult for participants to identify, are recommended to reduce negative side effects such as noncompliance. In addition to attention checks, other criteria, such as item-level response time analysis, should be used in combination to identify inattentive participants. It is crucial to carefully analyse all data before making decisions about participant elimination. Ethical considerations related to the use of attention checks are also discussed, recognizing the importance of maintaining participant trust and understanding the potential impact on survey completion rates and data quality. Overall, attention checks hold certain promise as a tool to enhance data quality, but further research and a thoughtful implementation are necessary to maximise their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Attention often disengages from primary tasks in favor of secondary tasks (i.e., multitasking) and task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., mind wandering). We assessed whether attentional disengagement, in the context of a cognitive task, can substantially differ between samples from commonly used online participant recruitment platforms, Prolific and Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Initially, eighty participants were recruited through Prolific to perform an attention task in which the risk of losing points for errors was varied (high risk\,=\,80\% chance of loss, low risk\,=\,20\% chance of loss). Attentional disengagement was measured via task performance along with self-reported mind wandering and multitasking. On Prolific, we observed surprisingly low levels of disengagement. We then conducted the same experiment on MTurk. Strikingly, MTurk participants exhibited more disengagement than Prolific participants. There was also an interaction between risk and platform, with the high-risk group exhibiting less disengagement, in terms of better task performance, than the low-risk group, but only on MTurk. Platform differences in individual traits related to disengagement and relations among study variables were also observed. Platform differences persisted, but were smaller, after increasing MTurk reputation criteria and remuneration in a second experiment. Therefore, recruitment platform and recruitment criteria could impact results related to attentional disengagement.},

The user can then act as a human judge to select the plot which he/she think has the real data and see if a correct choice is made. If a correct choice is made, it would be enough evidence to believe that the real plot is significantly different from the "null" plots.

	abstract = {Research and development in computer science and statistics have produced increasingly sophisticated software interfaces for interactive and exploratory analysis, optimized for easy pattern finding and data exposure. But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently “model free” and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems might enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference can be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},

	abstract = {Visual statistical inference is a way to determine signiﬁcance of patterns found while exploring data. It is dependent on the evaluation of a lineup, of a data plot among a sample of null plots, by human observers. Each individual is different in their cognitive psychology and judiciousness, which can affect the visual inference. The usual way to estimate the effectiveness of a statistical test is its power. The estimate of power of a lineup can be controlled by combining evaluations from multiple observers. Factors that may also affect the power of visual inference are the observers’ demographics, visual skills, and experience, the sample of null plots taken from the null distribution, the position of the data plot in the lineup, and the signal strength in the data. This paper examines these factors. Results from multiple visual inference studies using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk are examined to provide an assessment of these. The experiments suggest that individual skills vary substantially, but demographics do not have a huge effect on performance. There is evidence that a learning effect exists but only in that observers get faster with repeated evaluations, but not more often correct. The placement of data plot in the lineup does not affect the inference.},
